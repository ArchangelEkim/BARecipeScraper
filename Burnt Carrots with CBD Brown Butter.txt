Large carrots are ideal for this recipe since they’re big enough to get crispy-charred on the outside but stay just-tender and meaty inside. We developed this recipe using a 1,000 milligram (mg) bottle of Lily CBD. It's part of the Healthyish Guide to Cooking With, Eating, and Truly Enjoying Weed in collaboration with Broccoli.

4 servings

Ingredients:

1 lb. large carrots (about 3 fat ones), cut into ½"-thick rounds

1 Tbsp. extra-virgin olive oil

Kosher salt

2 small shallots, cut into ¼" rings

1 6" square sheet of nori, torn into bite-size pieces

1 small garlic clove, crushed

3 Tbsp. unsalted butter

½ tsp. CBD oil

2 Tbsp. fresh lime juice

Flaky sea salt

Recipe:

Place a rack in top third of oven; preheat to 450°. Toss carrots and olive oil on a large rimmed baking sheet. Season with kosher salt. Roast carrots until lightly charred around the edges and just-tender in the center. 15–18 minutes. Let cool slightly.

Meanwhile, cook shallots, nori, garlic, and butter in a small saucepan over medium heat, stirring often, until butter is browned and nutty-smelling and shallots are golden, 6–7 minutes. Add CBD oil and stir to combine.

Transfer carrots to a plate. Spoon butter dressing over. Drizzle with lime juice and season with sea salt.

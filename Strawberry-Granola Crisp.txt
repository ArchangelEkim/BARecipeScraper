Strawberry-Granola Crisp

This crisp is a delicious dessert, but also a perfectly acceptable brunch (or breakfast): The oat topping channels granola with olive oil, almonds, and maple syrup, and the filling is barely sweetened, instead taking advantage of in-season berries.

Ingredients:

2 lb. strawberries, hulled, halved, quartered if large

3 Tbsp. raw sugar

2 Tbsp. fresh lemon juice

1 Tbsp. plus 1½ tsp. cornstarch

Kosher salt

¼ cup extra-virgin olive oil

2 Tbsp. pure maple syrup

1 cup old-fashioned oats

⅓ cup sliced almonds

⅓ cup unsweetened shredded
coconut

¼ cup all-purpose flour

Plain yogurt, whipped cream, or vanilla ice cream (for serving; optional)

Recipe:

Place a rack in lower third of oven; preheat to 350°. Toss strawberries, sugar, lemon juice, cornstarch, and a pinch of salt in a large bowl to combine; transfer to a 9"-diameter pie dish or 1-qt. baking dish.

Stir oil and maple syrup in a medium bowl to combine. Add oats, almonds, coconut, flour, and 2 pinches of salt and work until mixture comes together in loose clumps; scatter over filling. Place crisp on a foil-lined rimmed baking sheet and bake until topping is golden brown and filling is bubbling, 35–45 minutes. Let cool at least 30 minutes before serving.

Serve crisp with yogurt, whipped cream, or ice cream, if desired.

Do Ahead: Crisp can be baked 1 day ahead. Let cool completely; cover and chill.
